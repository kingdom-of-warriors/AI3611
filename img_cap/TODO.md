# Project Roadmap

## Feature Implementations
- [X] Implement multi-encoder architecture support
  - Add compatibility for both ResNet and Vision Transformer encoders
  - Ensure seamless switching between encoder types

## Training Enhancements
- [ ] Implement scheduled sampling mechanism
  - Gradually transition from teacher forcing to model predictions
  - Add configurable sampling ratio scheduling

## Evaluation & Analysis
- [ ] Improve qualitative evaluation process
  - Generate and display best-performing samples
  - Generate and display worst-performing samples
  - Conduct comparative analysis between samples

## Dataset Expansion
- [ ] Scale up to larger dataset
  - Integrate complete Flickr40k dataset
  - Optimize data loading pipeline for larger dataset
